# Life Expectancy and GDP

### Introduction ###

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a broad statistical indicator of economic progress and is often used as a metric for international comparisons of relative wealth. 

GDP can be a poor measure of 'social progress' as it does not take into account;
-  Harm to the environment or distribution of said wealth. 


The project will seek to ascertain (for the nations in the data set);

- Has life expentency increased over time?
- Has GDP increased over time?
- What is the average life expectancy?
- What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

We shall also investigate;

Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy?
